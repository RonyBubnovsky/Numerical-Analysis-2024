# Matrix Operations in Python

This Python script demonstrates various operations on 3x3 matrices, including calculating determinants, multiplying matrices, checking identity matrices, finding inverse matrices using elementary matrices, and computing the condition number of a matrix.

## Purpose

The purpose of this script is to illustrate:

- **Matrix Determinant Calculation**: Calculates the determinant of a 3x3 matrix.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiplies two 3x3 matrices.
- **Identity Matrix Check**: Checks if a given 3x3 matrix is an identity matrix.
- **Matrix Inversion**: Finds the inverse of a 3x3 matrix using elementary row operations.
- **Condition Number Calculation**: Computes the condition number of a matrix using its determinant and the determinant of its inverse.

## Usage

To use the functions provided:

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Modify the `matrix` variable in the script with your desired 3x3 matrix.
4. Run the script.
