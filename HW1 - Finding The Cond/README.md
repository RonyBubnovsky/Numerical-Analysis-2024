# Matrix Operations in Python

## Purpose

This Python code is designed to perform various operations on 3x3 matrices, including calculating the determinant, checking if a matrix is an identity matrix, multiplying two matrices, and finding the inverse of a matrix. The code also demonstrates how to calculate the condition number of a matrix, which is a measure of the sensitivity of the solution of a system of linear equations to errors in the data.
